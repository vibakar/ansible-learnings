1. Update the playbook to add a second task.
The new task must execute the command cat /etc/hosts and change new task name to Execute a command to display hosts file.

------------------------------------------------------------------

2. You are assigned a task to restart a number of servers in a particular sequence. The sequence and the commands to be used are given below. Note that the commands should be run on respective servers only. Refer to the inventory file and update the playbook to create the below sequence.

Note: Use the description below to name the plays and tasks.

Stop the web services on web server nodes - service httpd stop
Shutdown the database services on db server nodes - service mysql stop
Restart all servers (web and db) at once - /sbin/shutdown -r
Start the database services on db server nodes - service mysql start
Start the web services on web server nodes - service httpd start
Warning: Do not use this playbook in a real setup. There are better ways to do these actions. This is only for simple practise.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

3.Update the playbook with a play to Execute a script on all web server nodes.
The script is located at /tmp/install_script.sh
Use the Script module

Update the playbook to add a new task to start httpd services on all web nodes
Use the Service module

-------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Update the playbook to add a new task in the beginning to add an entry into /etc/resolv.conf file for hosts. The line to be added is nameserver 10.1.250.10
Note: The new task must be executed first, so place it accordingly.

Use the Lineinfile module

-------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Update the playbook to add a new task at second position (right after adding entry to resolv.conf) to create a new web user.
Use the user module for this. User details to be used are given below:
Username: web_user
uid: 1040
group: developers
